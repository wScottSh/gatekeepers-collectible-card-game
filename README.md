# Gatekeepers Card Creation Tool

> The Gatekeepers web app is currently in production. Once complete, a link will be put here. Until then, please follow development on [Trello](https://trello.com/b/EvQ4EWf4).

Gatekeepers is a [Collectible Card Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collectible_card_game) where all cards are created by the player. This web app is the card creating module of the game. The player enters the requested card information into a React powered form, and saves it to a database to be viewed, edited, and deleted at any time.

Each card follows a very specific template with customizable areas within it. The base template will not be editable, but will act as the frame around the custom user generated content.

Specifically, the purpose of this project is to demonstrate the flexibility and power of Facebook's React JavaScript library.
